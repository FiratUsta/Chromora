# COLOR-THING: COLOR PALETTE GENERATOR

Color-Thing is a lightweight, powerful and fast color palette generator that can be used both online and offline as a PWA.

## Why Color-Thing?

Why should you use Color-Thing for your color palette generator needs? Because:

* It's lightweight, the entire repo is less than 500kb, this even includes the files that are not necessary to run the app like this README, or the picture on it.

* It's powerful, Color-Thing doesn't limit you to the 5 most common color palette types, you can create palettes that can have up to 36,000 colors.

* It's fast, it can generate 360 colors and find you the names of the closest color to all of them in 100ms on a i3-6006 with 4gb of RAM.

* It can work offline without any limitations, all of its functions including exporting and importing work offline. You can even install it on your device as a PWA.

* It's 100% FOSS, no log-ins, no pro subscriptions, no data collection, only colors!

## Want to give it a shot?

Check out the live instance over at [my website](https://ahmetfiratusta.com/stuff/color-thing)!

If you want to host an instance for yourself, just clone the repo and host it, no special set-up is needed.

## What's next?

* Directory restructure. Right now everything is a bit cluttered.

* Making the PWA/Offline support optional for those who want an even more lightweight version to host.

## What's not next?

Most likely full Webkit support unless someone makes a PR. I have no way of testing for iPhones or Macs. The only way I can test for Webkit is with Epiphany, on which everything seems to be fine (In reality, it's a mess on iPhones, a little better now on desktop Safari).

## "Your code sucks and is inefficient"

I know, it's a mess.
